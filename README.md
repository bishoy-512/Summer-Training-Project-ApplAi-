# Summer Training Project - APLLAI  

This repository contains my **Summer Training Project** completed at **APLLAI** as part of my college program at **Faculty of Computers and Information, Ain Shams University**.  

The project focuses on applying different **Machine Learning algorithms** to real-world datasets, covering the full pipeline from **data preprocessing** to **model evaluation**.

## üìå Project Overview  
- Performed **data cleaning and preprocessing** (handling missing values, encoding categorical data, scaling).  
- Implemented and compared different **ML models** such as:  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
  - Decision Tree  
  - Linear Regression  
- Used **cross-validation** and **GridSearchCV** for hyperparameter tuning.  
- Visualized results with **matplotlib** and **seaborn**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used  
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
